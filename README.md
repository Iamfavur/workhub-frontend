# WorkHub

WorkHub is a modern freelance marketplace web application inspired by platforms like Fiverr. It enables users to register as buyers or sellers, create and manage gigs, place orders, exchange messages, and collaborate efficiently.
It has a timed deadline counter that is used to show how much time is left for a seller to deliver an order. The counter typically updates in real-time (counting down seconds, minutes, hours, or days) and helps both buyers and sellers track progress and meet deadlines efficiently.
